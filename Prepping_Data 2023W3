REQUIREMENTS
For the transactions file:
- Filter the transactions to just look at DSB 
  - These will be transactions that contain DSB in the Transaction Code field
- Rename the values in the Online or In-person field, Online of the 1 values and In-Person for the 2 values
- Change the date to be the quarter 
- Sum the transaction values for each quarter and for each Type of Transaction (Online or In-Person)

For the targets file:
- Pivot the quarterly targets so we have a row for each Type of Transaction and each Quarter (help)
- Rename the fields
- Remove the 'Q' from the quarter field and make the data type numeric (help)

Join the two datasets together 
- You may need more than one join clause!

Remove unnecessary fields
Calculate the Variance to Target for each row
